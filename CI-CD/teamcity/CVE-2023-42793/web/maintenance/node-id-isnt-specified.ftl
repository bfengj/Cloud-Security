[#escape text as text?html]

    <p>This server does not have an ID and cannot start without it.</p>
    <p>Most probably, this server was created as a main node and operated without an ID.
        As the "Main node" responsibility is already assigned to another server, the current server starts as secondary and, like all secondary nodes, requires an ID
    </p>
    <p>
        To resolve this issue, please define the node's ID via the <span class="mono mono-12px">-Dteamcity.server.nodeId</span> JVM argument
        and specify its direct URL via <span class="mono mono-12px">-Dteamcity.server.rootURL</span>. Restart the server to apply the changes.
    </p>
